## Overview

![Overview](https://github.com/ifelsebreak/MatchFlix-Angular/blob/master/src/assets/MatchFlix-%E2%80%93-Mozilla-Firefox-2021-12-17-12-39-33.gif?raw=true)
Angular remake of my previous [repository](https://github.com/ifelsebreak/MatchFlix-flutter). See that for more details.

Made with Angular 12 and TypeScript, uses [themoviedb.org](http://themoviedb.org) API for movie data. Basic FireBase implementation.

## DISCLAIMER

- The app takes the data from the themoviedb.org API: you must sign up on their website and get your own API key and set it as the value of the "tmdbAPIkey" variable in /lib/movie-list.dart.
- You need to set up your FireBase accont and link it to your flutter project through the google-services.json file provided by Google.
- Tested on android (Chrome + Firefox), Windows and Linux (Chrome + Firefox) and iPad (Safari)
